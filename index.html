  <h3>
    I can hardly believe it's been 18 years since I first held you in my arms. It feels like just yesterday you were a little boy, full of curiosity and wonder. Now, here you are, all grown up, smart, kind, and so incredibly talented in ways that continue to amaze me. You’ve always had such a big heart, and I’ve watched you grow into an amazing young man with so much to offer the world.

I’m so proud of everything you’ve become—and everything I know you’ll continue to be. As you step into new chapters of your life, always remember the importance of taking care of yourself. You’ve got so much to give to others, but remember, you need to recharge and look after your own well-being, too. It’s okay to take time for you—in fact, it’s more than okay, it’s necessary.

I want you to know that no matter what, I’m always here for you. No matter where life takes you, or what challenges you face, I’m right behind you—cheering you on, supporting you, and ready to help whenever you need it. You’re never alone, and I’ll always have your back. That's my priority. I'm sorry for the times in the past that I was not there for you or Ean like I needed to be. I had to overcome a lot. Still, that's not an excuse I am content with. 

<br>Enjoy every moment of this special day, and every day, and know that I love you more than words can say.
    <br>
